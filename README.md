Files in folder "0bar"

Each file with name starting with Actives for each time moment of the simulation has number of active citizens, number of intimidated citizens, number of LEOs. These files are provided for lattice sizes from 100 to 600 and different random seeds.

Each file with name starting with Day for each non-intimidated agent has his/her x-coordinate, y-coordinate, agent's state, agent's risk aversion, agent's hardship, total number of days of being active and -1. Last two values are not used. If an agent is LEO, then last four numbers are -1. These files are provided for each time moment of the simulation, each lattice size and the corresponding random seed used. For example, file "Day_10000_100_111.txt" provides information on the lattice situation at time moment 10000 with lattice size 100 and random seed 111.
